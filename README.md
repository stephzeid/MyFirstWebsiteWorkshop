MyFirstWebsiteWorkshop
======================

Free workshop for IEEE Day!

The planned workshop today is to be able to create the Google Page. I will be tracking everything through here. Let's see how it goes!! :)

Learning about static websites
Notes of the course: 
 - Downloading a text Editor (Sublime)
 - Making sure we have Chrome or Firefox for internet browsers
 - <p> is used to start the code and </p> is used to end the code
- <h1> or <h2> ... the smaller the number the bigger the word
- <hr> used to add a line on the page
- CSS: Cascading Style Sheets -> makes the website look pretty
- When you have more then one <p> you can add an identification number to differentiate them ( <p id="id1">) then in CSS you can identify it as #id1 and style it how you want
